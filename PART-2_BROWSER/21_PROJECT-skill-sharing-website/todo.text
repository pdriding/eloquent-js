**Step 1: Identify the Problem**  
- When a talk is updated (for example, when a new comment is added in another window), the entire talk component is redrawn.  
- Redrawing resets any active inputs, so if a user is typing a comment, their input and focus are lost.

**Step 2: Use a Stateful Talk Component**  
- Instead of replacing the entire DOM node, treat each talk as an object that maintains its state.  
- Give each talk component a method (e.g., `syncState`) that updates its internal data (like new comments) without resetting user input.

**Step 3: Keep Track of Components**  
- Maintain a data structure (like a dictionary or map) that uses talk titles (or another unique identifier) as keys.  
- This structure will help you quickly determine if a component for a given talk already exists.

**Step 4: Synchronize with Updated Data**  
- **Loop Over New Talks:**  
  - For each talk in the updated list, check if a corresponding component exists.  
  - **If it exists:** Call its `syncState` method to update the talk’s content while preserving the comment field’s current state.  
  - **If it doesn’t exist:** Create a new talk component and add it to your data structure.

- **Clean Up Removed Talks:**  
  - Loop through your existing components.  
  - For each one, verify whether the corresponding talk still exists in the updated data.  
  - Remove any components whose talks have been deleted.

This process allows you to update the talk list dynamically while ensuring that active comment fields remain undisturbed.
